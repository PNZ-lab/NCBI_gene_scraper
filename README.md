# NCBI_gene_scraper
 Given a list of genes, returns summaries from NCBI

Simply edit the code so that genes_unformatted contains a series of genes with one gene per line.
This text is formatted to a list containing the gene names, iteratively sent to NCBI, and prints out a summary per gene in a tsv-separated fashion.
This output can be easily formatted to a table by pasting in excel and copying from there.
